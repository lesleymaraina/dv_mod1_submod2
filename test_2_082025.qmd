Goal: Turn numbers into narratives



## Storytelling in biomedical science


<div style="font-size: 80%">
::: incremental
-  Turning analysis into a clear, decision-ready narrative that clinicians, researchers, and stakeholders can act on
-  Outline a structured **argument**:
    - Narrative arc: context $\rightarrow$ question $\rightarrow$ method $\rightarrow$ result $\rightarrow$ implication
- Consider your **audience**:
    - Datasets can be used with different emphasis depending on the audience
    - For clinicians (risk/benefit), scientists (validity/limitations), and ops/executives (feasibility/cost)
- Evidence-centered: 
    - Primary figure(s) that directly answers the question, with annotations and baselines.

## Data-to-story workflow: Narrative arc

::: incremental
-  **Context**: What decision/problem? Who is affected?
- **Question**: Precisely stated, decision-relevant
- **Result**: Effect size with uncertainty and baseline
- **Implication**: Action, risks, monitoring plan
- **Limitations**: What would change your conclusion?
